## Rev. 3-6 Case files

The top shell and mid layer files in this folder are to be used with FR4 plates. Each edge has been extended out by 2mm to cover up the sides of the FR4 plates.

The top shell has been designed to be threaded into directly from underneath using M2 screws that are 16mm in length.

For the right 65% half with blocker, the blocker is for the 2.75u/1.25u/1.25u/blocker/1u/1u/1u bottom row configuration.

These files are compatible with Rev. 3-6. If you have the prototype version of the Rev. 4 (Red PCB), the right half PCB is a bit wider, so you will need to use the `Rev. 4 Proto` version of the right half files. The regular version of the Rev. 4 has a purple PCB.

### Rev. 6

The left half PCB for the Rev. 6 slightly sticks out more on the right edge of the PCB, so it is not compatible with the mid layer STLs for Rev. 3-5. Use the Rev. 6 ones for Left Macro or Left No Macro, as the wall has been made thinner at that portion to allow the PCB to fit into the case properly.
