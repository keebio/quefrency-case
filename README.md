Case files for the [Quefrency](https://keeb.io/collections/quefrency-split-staggered-65-keyboard).

## Enclosed Case

![](images/rev3-shells.jpeg)

Inside of the [enclosed-case directory](enclosed-case/) are files to print an enclosing shell around the board. They will need to be used in conjuction with the [FR4](https://keeb.io/products/quefrency-fr4-plates?utm_source=github) or [Aluminum plates](https://keeb.io/products/quefrency-black-aluminum-plates?utm_source=github) from the store.

These files are compatible with Rev. 2 through 6. For Rev. 2, use the middle layer files marked with `Rev. 2`.

## Rev. 3-6

The only difference between Rev. 2 and 3 is that Rev. 3 replaced the TRRS port with a USB-C port.
