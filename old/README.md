## Rev. 1 vs. Rev. 2

The difference between Rev 1 and Rev 2 plates are the following:

- Rev 2 does not have Alps support, while Rev 1 does
- Rev 2 adds ISO support and a few more bottom row layout options
- Rev 2 has a different arrangement of screw/standoff holes to allow for an acrylic mid layer to be used

## Rev. 2

All of the DXF files are in metric (millimeters).

### Switch Plates
The plate files in the [main rev2 directory](rev2/) are designed for 1.5mm thick plates. If doing acrylic plates, then either a thickness of 3mm or 5mm should be used. Files for these thicker plates can be found in the [3mm Plates](rev2/3mm Plates) and [5mm Plates](rev2/5mm Plates) directories. The difference with these thicker plates is that the stabilizer cutouts are larger to accomdate the stabilzer housing and wire.
